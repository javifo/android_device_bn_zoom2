# So what does this do?  It converts an encore /root "ramdisk" from
# supporting emmc to supporting SD.  Basically it just converts the
# init.encore.rc to point to the SD partitions as follows:
#
# /system == p2
# /data   == p3
# /cache  == p5
#
# run this script from $OUT -- basically the place you found it.  The
# resulting file "ramdisk.img" can be renamed "uRamdisk" and placed
# in mmcblk1p1 -- the vfat /boot partition.
#
# if you get an error about "mkimage" not being found, you'll need to
# . build/envsetup.sh

if [ ! -f $(which mkimage) ]; then echo "Y U NO Have mkimage?"; exit 0; fi
